To Do:
-Build rule-based bidding procedures into the AI (Hand class).
-Build bid method into the Round class.
-Build play method into the Round class, where a Trick will be initialized based on the results of the bid, and then played out.
-Build play method for the Game class, where the Rounds are automatically formed and played by the computer AI.
-Build the user interface for interactive euchre playing, and write the script for initialize a manually-controlled game.
